   <h1><u>STAR NETWORK TOPOLOGY</u></h1>


   <p>In the <b>star network topology</b>, there is a central computer or server to which all the workstation are directly connected. Every 
    workstation is indirectly connected to every other through the central computer. A <b>star network</b> is a 
    <i><u>local area network(LAN)</u></i> in which all nodes(workstations or other devices) are directly connected to a common central computer.</p>
   
   <p>Every workstations is indirectly connected to every other though the central computer. In some starn network,the center computer can 
    also operate as a workstation. the illustration shows a star network with five workstations(or six,if the central compute acts as a 
    workstation). Each workstation is show as a spher,the center computer is shown as a larger sphere,and connections are show as straight lines.
     The connections can be wired or wireless links. </p>
