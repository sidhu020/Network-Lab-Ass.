<h3>PAN</h3>
<img src="pan.png"  border="1px">
<p  border="1px">Personal Area Network (PAN): It is an interconnection of personal technology devices to communicate over a short distance, which is less than 33
    feet or 10 meters or within the range of an individual person, typically using some form of wireless technologies.</p>

    <h3>WAN</h3>

    <p>
        In its simplest form, a wide-area network (WAN) is a collection of local-area networks (LANs) or other networks that communicate with one another.  A WAN 
         is essentially a network of networks, with the Internet the world's largest WAN.<br> Today, there are several types of WANs, built for a variety of use cases that 
        touch  virtually every aspect of modern life.</p>

    <h3>LAN</h3>
    <img src="LAN.JPG" height="30%" width="30%">
    <p>A local area network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home. A LAN can be 
         small or large, ranging from a home network with one user to an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices in an office or school.</p></div><br><br>

            <h3>SAN</h3>
            <img src="san.jfif" height="30%" width="30%">
            <p> A storage area network (SAN) is a dedicated, independent high-speed network that interconnects and delivers shared pools of storage devices to multiple
                servers. Each server can access shared storage as if it were a drive directly attached to the server. A SAN is typically assembled with cabling, host bus
                 adapters, and SAN switches attached to storage arrays and servers. Each switch
                  and storage system on the SAN must be interconnected.</p>

<h3>MAN</h3>
<img src="MAN.gif" height="30%" width="30%">
<P>A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that connects computers within a metropolitan area, which could be a single large city, multiple cities and towns, 
    or any given large area with multiple buildings. A MAN is larger than a local area network (LAN) but smaller than a wide area network (WAN). MANs do not have to be in urban areas; 
      the term "metropolitan" implies the size of the network, not the demographics of the area that it serves.</P>
