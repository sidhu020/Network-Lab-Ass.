    <p>HTML5 is a markup language for structuring and presenting content for the World Wide
        Web and a core technology of the Internet. It is the fifth revision of the HTML 
        standard and, as of December 2012, is a candidate recommendation of the World Wide
         Web Consortium (W3C).</font></p><BR>


            <font color="GREEN"> <H1>Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest 
            multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood 
            by computers and devices. HTML5 is intended to subsura (include) not only HTML 4,
             but also XHTML 1.</H1></font>

             <font color=#e820b6> <SMALL><P>It introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs)
                 for complex web applications. Many features of HTML5 have been built with 
                 the consideration of being able to run on low-powered devices such as smartphones
                  and tablets. HTML5 adds many new syntactic features. These include the new, and 
                  elements, as well as the integration of scalable vector graphics (SVG) content
                   (that replaces the uses of generictags) and MathML for mathematical formulas.
                    These features are designed to make it easy to include and handle multimedia
                     and graphical content on the web without having to resort to proprietary
                      plugins and APIs.</P></SMALL></font>
